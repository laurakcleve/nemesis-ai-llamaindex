"Nemesis is a semi-cooperative game where you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you will have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, the other players that will have their own agendas and, sometimes, just cruel fate. The gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climatic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.\n\nSetup\nBoard Setup\nPlace the board on the table. Use the basic side of the board as shown in the picture. Note: The basic side of the board is marked by a red arrow icon in its upper left corner. Shuffle all Room tiles \"2\" without looking at their fronts and randomly place (face down) one Room tile \"2\" on each of the Room slots marked with a \"2\" on the board. Put all remaining Room tiles \"2\" back in the box. Note: You will not use all available Room tiles \"2\" each game, as there are more tiles than slots on the board. Players never know exactly which Rooms are on the ship. Note: When putting any components back in the box, avoid looking at their contents. Then, use the same method to place all Room tiles \"1\" on the Room slots marked with a \"1\". Take the Exploration tokens, shuffle them (without looking at their fronts) and place one token at random (face down) on each Room tile. Put all remaining Exploration tokens back in the box. Take the Coordinates cards and place one randomly (face down) on its space next to the Cockpit. Put all remaining Coordinates cards back in the box. Place 1 Status marker on the \"B\" space on the Destination Track. This is the Destination marker.  Take the corresponding number of randomly chosen Escape Pod tokens: 1-2 players: 2 Escape Pods.  3-4 players: 3 Escape Pods.  5 players: 4 Escape Pods.  Place the lowest-numbered Escape Pod in Section \"A\", then place the next (in numerical order) Escape Pod in Section \"B\". Place the other Escape Pods, alternating between \"A\" and \"B\". Escape Pod tokens should be placed with their \"Locked\" side face up. Put all remaining Escape Pods back in the box. Take both Engine tokens marked with the number \"1\" (1 Damaged and 1 Working) and shuffle them face down. Place them on the corresponding Engine \"1\" slot on the board, one atop the other, and face down. The top Engine token indicates the true status of the Engine. Repeat this step for Engine tokens \"2\" and \"3\". Important: Make sure that the players do not see the fronts of the tokens, so that they will not know if the Engines are working or not. Take the Intruder board, put it next to the board and place in the corresponding slots: 5 Egg tokens. 3 random Weakness cards. They are placed face down, so that players will not know what Weaknesses they can discover during a given game. Put all remaining Weakness cards back in the box. Take the Intruder bag and put the following Intruder tokens inside: 1 Blank, 4 Larvae, 1 Creeper, 1 Queen, 3 Adults. Then, add 1 additional Adult Intruder token for each player taking part in the game. The rest of the Intruder tokens are placed next to the board - they will be used during play. Place the Intruder Carcass tokens next to the board as well - they will mark killed Intruders. Shuffle and place the following decks face down next to the board: 3 Items [each with its own color], Event, Intruder Attack, Contamination and Serious Wound decks.  Place the Craft Item deck next to the 3 Item decks. Place the Scanner next to the Contamination deck.

Place 1 Status marker on the green space of the Time Track. This is the Time marker. The board setup is now complete!\n\nCrew Setup\nTake as many Help Cards as there are players and deal one to each player at random. These cards determine the order of choosing Characters. If there are 3 players, take the cards with the number 1-3, if there are 4 players, take cards 1-4 etc. The number shown on the Help Card and Inventory is the Player Number - it's not only important for choosing Character, but also for some Objectives. Put all remaining Help cards back in the box. Each player gets 1 plastic Inventory Card holder with the same number as their Help card. It is used to keep your Item cards hidden during the game. This is your Inventory, the place where you store all your non-Heavy Items, so you know what you have, while the other players may only guess. Remove from both Objective Decks (Corporate and Personal) all cards showing a number of players higher than the number of players taking part in the game. Shuffle these two decks individually and deal each player 1 card from the Corporate Objectives deck and 1 card from the Personal Objectives deck. Each player must keep the contents of their Objective cards hidden from the other players! Put all remaining Objective cards back in the box. When any of the Characters encounters an Intruder for the first time, you will have to choose one of the two Objectives you want to complete during the game. Hint: There's a good reason why the players receive their Objectives before Character drafts! Knowing your Objective, you can pick a Character that has the best chance to fulfill it. Shuffle all the Character draft cards. The players choose their Characters in the following order : Player 1 takes 2 random Character draft cards, reveals them, chooses 1 and shuffles the other back into the Character draft deck. Next, Player 2 chooses their Character the same way, then Player 3, etc. A player may only control the Character whose card they have chosen during the draft. After the draft, put all remaining Character draft cards back in the box, as they will no longer be used. Each player takes the following components: The Character board of the Character chosen during the draft. The miniature of their Character and places it in the Hibernatorium. Place your Character miniature in a colored plastic ring. The Action cards deck of their Character, shuffles it and places it on the left side of their Character board, face down. The Starting Item card (Weapon) of their Character and places it in one of the two Hand slots on their Character board. Afterwards, place a number of Ammo markers equal to that Weapon's Ammo capacity on the Weapon card. The 2 Quest Items of their Character and places them, horizontal side up, next to their Character board. Those items are NOT active at the start of the game, but players can perform mini-quests to unlock them during the game. Take all remaining Character boards and put them back in the box.

If the game (at any time) requires you to draw a card and add it to your hand, and your Action deck is empty, shuffle all the cards in your discard pile - these will form your new Action deck. Then, draw the required number of cards.\n2. First Player Token - After all the Players have drawn their Action cards, the player with the First Player token passes it to the player on their left. Note: In the first turn of the game, do not pass the First Player token. Each time players are required to do anything in order, start with the player with the First Player token, and then continue with each player in clockwise order.\n3. Player Rounds - Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player performs a round of 2 Actions. When each player has performed their round of 2 Actions (or passed their round), the next series of rounds takes place. Each player in order performs 2 Actions (or passes) - this takes place as long as there is at least one player who has not passed. When all players have passed, move to the Event Phase. If a player cannot perform any Actions, or chooses to take no Actions in their round, they must pass. If a player performs only 1 Action instead of the required two, they must pass. Any player who already passed cannot perform ANY Actions later during that Phase. When a player passes, they may discard any number of cards from their hand to their Discard. When you pass, flip your Help card to the \"Pass\" side to indicate this. Note: When a Character ends their round in a Room with a Fire marker, they always suffer 1 Light Wound - see Fire marker, page 17.\nII. Event Phase - Resolve the following steps:\n4. Time Track - Move the Time marker on the Time Track by 1 space to the right. If the Self-Destruct Sequence is active, also move its marker by 1 space to the right on its Track.\n5. Intruder Attack - Each Intruder in Combat with a Character attacks them.\n6. Fire Damage - Each Intruder in the same Room as a Fire marker suffers 1 Injury.\n7. Resolve Event Card - Draw and resolve 1 Event card:\nIntruder Movement - All Intruders sharing the Intruder Symbol shown on the Event card (and that are NOT in a Room with any Characters) move to a neighboring Room through the Corridor showing the number on the Event card. Only the Intruders whose symbol appears on the card (and that are not in Combat) are moved through the corridor displaying the same direction number as the card. If the number indicates a Technical Corridor, remove that Intruder miniature from the board and put its corresponding Intruder token in the Intruder bag. Event Effect - After the Intruder movement step, resolve the effect described on the Event card. After resolving the Event card, discard it in the Event discard pile (unless the text on the card says differently).", "start_char_idx": 6522, "end_char_idx": 10841, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "453e8398-84a3-4ad4-8e9e-1a5456a0f434": {"__data__": {"id_": "453e8398-84a3-4ad4-8e9e-1a5456a0f434", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58bc04a-3687-4aac-adda-30c622da9546", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "ac492e49fe5fe5b17600e4d28e54001c5455863187a1dbaaae79f92a6ff0a8d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfe08cea-dc11-486f-9107-ce71f59220b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "12cb158690ab576e19dd52052d059ba3e74849ca151e7b167a6d4524705a757f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c26e12f-697b-45ae-9449-cdba022c3771", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c186c430ad10c039bae161f4d8f86be211cc219fc68993070b2f39048ebc24c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "6.

If the Event deck runs out of cards (this, however, happens very rarely), shuffle the discarded Event cards - they become the new Event deck.\n8. Intruder Bag Development\nDraw 1 Intruder token from the Intruder bag. The effect depends on the drawn token: Larva - Remove this token from the Intruder bag and add 1 Adult token to the Intruder bag. Creeper - Remove this token from the Intruder bag and add 1 Breeder token to the Intruder bag. Adult - All players roll for Noise in order. If a player's Character is in Combat with an Intruder, this player does not perform a Noise roll. Return the Adult Intruder token to the Intruder bag. Breeder - All players roll for Noise in order. If a player's Character is in Combat with an Intruder, this player does not perform a Noise roll. Return the Breeder Intruder token to the Intruder bag. Queen - If there are any Characters in the Nest Room, place the Queen miniature in that Room and resolve an Encounter. If there are no Characters in the Nest (or its location has not been discovered yet), add an additional Egg token on the Intruder board. Return the Queen Intruder token to the Intruder bag. Blank - Add 1 Adult Intruder token to the Intruder bag. If there are no Adult Intruder tokens available, nothing happens. Return the Blank token to the Intruder bag.\n9. End of the Turn\nStart a new turn - The turn ends after the Intruder bag development step has been fully resolved. It means that all Encounters, Surprise Attacks etc. must have been played out. After that, a new turn starts with the Player Phase and all players draw their Action cards.\n\nPlayers Goals\nA game of Nemesis may result in multiple winners, but it is not a cooperative game - while the players can (and should, to some degree) cooperate, each player has their own Objective to fulfill. Other players achieving their goals are irrelevant to your own victory. To consider a player a winner, they must meet 2 conditions: 1. Fulfill their objective, detailed on the Objective card chosen by the player. 2. Survive - meaning one of these two options: [1] hibernate their Character in the Hibernatorium with the ship still functioning and jumping to Earth OR [2] use one of the Escape Pods to evacuate the ship. Important: Some Objective cards may ask a Character to change the ship S destination - for instance, the ship must be redirected to Mars instead of going back to Earth.\n\nEnd of the Game\nThe game ends when one of the following conditions is met: 1: The Time marker moves on the final red space of the Time Track - the ship jumps into hyperspace immediately. All characters on board who are not in hibernation die from the massive g-force. Important: Instant death due to hyperjump does not apply to the Intruders, so if your Objective was to kill the Queen, a Breeder or to destroy the Nest, your target is unharmed, and you fail your mission. 2: The Self-Destruct marker moves on to the final red space of the Self-Destruct Track (the one with \"skull\" icon) OR you are instructed to place a 9th Fire marker or a 9th Malfunction marker - the ship explodes /loses hull integrity and all the Characters on board (both awake and hibernated) die. Everything else on board the ship also dies, including Intruders (this may be important for some Objectives).", "start_char_idx": 9953, "end_char_idx": 14123, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c26e12f-697b-45ae-9449-cdba022c3771": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c26e12f-697b-45ae-9449-cdba022c3771", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58bc04a-3687-4aac-adda-30c622da9546", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "ac492e49fe5fe5b17600e4d28e54001c5455863187a1dbaaae79f92a6ff0a8d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "453e8398-84a3-4ad4-8e9e-1a5456a0f434", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "2c63398a46fc5ab4d64795a88e9957087fe8da92a910323b0f127dfe05ee34e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c39b32d-0bc6-4b5d-b788-cfbd1f1af4d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d03a12b0d5b6182d36b52e6a0390ea43eda6b941c3d6ea8d3d30b129a6052b7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All characters on board who are not in hibernation die from the massive g-force.

Everything else on board the ship also dies, including Intruders (this may be important for some Objectives). 3: The last alive, not hibernating Character on board the ship dies, hibernates or uses an Escape Pod - meaning there is nothing more to do on the ship.\nIf the Self-Destruct sequence was active, move its marker to the final red space of the Self-Destruct Track. If not, move the Time marker to the final red space of the Time Track. In both cases resolve the effects of those markers as described above. If one of the conditions above is met and at least 1 Character survived (either asleep in the Hibernatorium or evacuated in an Escape Pod), go to the Victory Check step.\n\nVictory Check\n1. Engines Check - If the ship survived up to this moment, its Engines are checked. Re -veal all the top Engine tokens of the three Engines. If 2 or 3 of the top Engine tokens have a Damaged status, the ship explodes and all the hibernating Characters die. Everything else on board also dies, including all the Intruders (this may be important for some Objectives). Note: A Malfunction marker in the Engine Room only disables that Room Action. If the Engine has a Working status, it does not count as Damaged, regardless of the mentioned Malfunction marker.\n2. Coordinates Check - If the ship survived up to this moment, reveal the Coordinates card and check the current space of the Destination marker. If the ship is not headed toward Earth, all Characters asleep in the Hibernatorium die. The Quarantine Objective, which requires another destination for the jump (Mars ), is the only exception to this rule. Any Character with this Objective does not die if they are a sleep in the Hibernatorium and the ship 's destination is Mars. Important: Instant death due to a destination other than Earth does not apply to the Intruders! Note: In this case, although the Characters die, the ship is not destroyed.\n3. Contamination Check - Each alive Character (either asleep in the Hibernatorium or evacuated in an Escape Pod) checks their Contamination cards. The player Scans all the Contamination cards in their Action deck, discard pile and hand. If there is at least 1 \"INFECTED\" card, that player shuffles all their cards (both Action and Contamination) to create a new Action deck, then draws the 4 top cards. If there is at least 1 Contamination card (Infected or not), the Character dies. If there are none, they are lucky to survive. If there is a Larva on the Character's Board, the player skips step A and resolves step B.\n4. Objective Check - If there are any Characters alive up to this step, you only have to check if you accomplished your chosen Objective. Each player whose Character is still alive at this step must check if they accomplished their chosen Objective. They all reveal their Objective card to the other players and check if they have met all its requirements.\n\nEnding The Game Before The Other Players\nIf any Character uses an Escape Pod, hibernates or dies, then they can no longer actively participate in the game, and can only spectate. At the end of the game, the Characters that are still alive determine if all their Objectives have been met and thus if they have won or not. The Player whose Character is the first to die may continue the game as an Intruder.\n\nCritical Gameplay Moments\nDuring the game, there are two critical moments that are not tied to any specific turn, but are triggered under certain conditions:\n1. The First Encounter with an Intruder - The first time a crew member encounters an Intruder, every one has to make a choice - either follow corporate directives or fulfill their personal objectives.

The First Encounter with an Intruder - The first time a crew member encounters an Intruder, every one has to make a choice - either follow corporate directives or fulfill their personal objectives.  When the first Intruder miniature (of any type) appears on the board, the situation changes drastically. Each player immediately chooses 1 of their 2 Objective cards. The one that wasn't chosen is removed from the game face down (without showing it to the other players). Then, the encounter that triggered this procedure is resolved and the game continues normally. From now on, each player has only 1 Objective left and they must work toward its completion (it must still be kept secret from the other players). Note: Players cannot look at the removed Objective cards of the other players!\n2. First Dead Character - The first time a Character (of any player) dies, the ship's AI immediately starts emergency procedures: All Escape Pods are automatically unlocked (flip their tokens to the Unlocked side). For the rest of the game they may be locked (and unlocked) normally (for example using the Hatch Control System Room Action).\n\nSelf-destruct And Hibernation:\nThere are also 2 additional important moments that sometimes happen in the game:\n1. Hibernation Chambers Open: When the Time Track reaches any blue space, the Hibernation chambers open. Characters CANNOT enter them before that moment.\n2. Self-destruct Is Critical: When the Self-Destruct Track reaches any yellow space, all Escape Pods are automatically unlocked and the Characters can no longer stop the Self-Destruct sequence.\n\nObjectives\nSince completing most of the Objectives requires some knowledge of the game (for example Room actions, rules for destroying the ship, Escape Pods functionality, etc)., you'll find some tips below that may help beginner players to find the appropriate sections in the Manual. Important: No matter which Objective you choose, your Character must survive the game! That means, they must either get into an Escape Pod and launch it or hibernate.\nPlayer X's character cannot survive: This means that the Character of the indicated player cannot be alive at the end of the game (they cannot hibernate or escape using an Escape Pod). You do not need to kill them with any of your Actions - they simply must be dead. You might want to trap this Character in a Room on Fire or with an Intruder. Maybe you could seek another player's help? You can also escape the ship by using the Escape Pods, abandoning the rest of the crew on board with Fire, Malfunctions, Damaged Engines, Self-Destruct procedure or Coordinates leading to nowhere and hope that everybody dies or that the ship explodes.\nYour character is the only survivor: No Character but yours may survive the game.\nSending the signal: Send the Signal means you need to locate the Comms Room and perform its Room Action. There is always a Comms Room on board - for the Rooms with the number \"1\" on their back\nThe ship must reach earth/mars: The ship will reach its destination if the right Coordinates have been set in the Cockpit and if at least two of its three Engines are still functional (Working status).\nDiscover a weakness: Weaknesses can be discovered by bringing an Object to the Laboratory and by performing the Laboratory Room Action there. It doesn't matter if you're not the one who did the research, as long as the Weakness has been discovered at the end of the game. Intruders' Eggs may be found in the Nest. The Nest is always on the board - look for the Rooms with the number \"1\" on their back. The Laboratory is always on the board - look for the Rooms with the numb er \"1\" on their back.\nDestroy the nest: The Nest is destroyed when there are no Intruder Eggs left in it. To destroy Eggs, check the Nest description on the Room sheet. The Nest is always on the board - look for the Rooms with the number \" 1\" on their back.\n\nDuring each of their rounds, players can perform various Actions.

There are 4 groups of Actions in the game: 1. Basic Actions, 2. Actions from Action cards, 3. Actions from Item cards, 4. Actions from Room tiles.\nAction Cost: Each Action displays an Action icon. The number in any given Action icon indicates the Cost of performing the given Action. In order to pay the Cost, the player must discard the exact number of any chosen Action cards from their hand. Discarded cards are placed face up in the discard pile. Important: Even though they're included in the Action deck, Contamination cards are not Action cards. They cannot be discarded from your hand to pay any Action Cost. Contamination cards represent the exhaustion of your Character and sometimes something even worse.\n\nSome of the Actions and Items specify when they may be used: In Combat Only - The Character may perform this Action only in Combat. A Character is considered to be in Combat if there is an Intruder in their Room. Eggs do not count as Intruders. Out Of Combat Only - The Character may perform this Action only when they are NOT in Combat. If a given Action is not marked by any of the symbols above, that means this Action may be performed both in Combat and out of it.\n\n1. Basic Actions\nEach Character has the same set of Basic Actions. These Actions are always available for each Character, as long as they meet their conditions. A detailed description of these Actions is given below.\nMovement: move your Character miniature to the neighboring Room, applying all the Movement basic rules.\nCareful Movement: works exactly like Movement, but instead of performing a Noise roll after moving, place a Noise marker in a chosen Corridor connected to the Room you are entering. If there is a Noise marker in all the Corridors connected to the Room you want to move to, you cannot perform a Careful Movement. You cannot perform Careful Movement if you are in Combat. Any given Corridor may never hold more than 1 Noise marker. ore on Movement, Noise rolls and Noise markers.\nShoot: attack an Intruder with a Weapon placed in your Character's Hand, discarding an Ammo marker from that Weapon's cad. You can only Shoot Intruders in the same Room as your Character.\nMelee Attack: attack an Intruder with your bare hands (or anything you can improvise). You can only attack Intruders in the same Room as your Character.\nPick Up Heavy Object: Pick Up 1 Heavy Object present in the Room you are in. It can be a Character Corpse, an Intruder Carcass or an Intruder Egg. Note: When you Search and find Heavy Items, you are not required to use this Action. This Action applies only to Objects.\nTrade: start a trade with all Characters in the same Room as your Character. Players may now show each other any Item cards and Objects they want to trade. If both involved players agree on the transaction, they exchange the items. Even though several players may take part in the Trade, the only player that performs the Action is the one that started it. A player can choose to give an Item card or Object without asking anything in return. Note: Characters cannot exchange Ammo.\nCraft Item: discard 2 Item cards showing the appropriate blue Craft icons to gain a Crafted Item card with the same Craft icons (but in gray color) as the Items you have discarded. A Crafted Item cannot be built if its card is not available, even if you have the required blue components.\n\n2. Actions from Action Cards\nEach Character has its own, partially unique set of 10 Action cards representing the Actions which can be performed by this Character. The description of each Action is detailed on the corresponding Action card. To perform an Action from an Action card, discard this card from your hand (face up) and pay its Cost.", "start_char_idx": 20775, "end_char_idx": 25144, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4355a52e-f9f6-404f-b1f2-9a7a0eda2cd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "4355a52e-f9f6-404f-b1f2-9a7a0eda2cd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58bc04a-3687-4aac-adda-30c622da9546", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "ac492e49fe5fe5b17600e4d28e54001c5455863187a1dbaaae79f92a6ff0a8d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "139eea01-bff3-4bb3-8f85-07d732fa53a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "f7539d8dac76395339c8abd0682c460a608d0f9938b65f878d7437ef72e446cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33e3134a-5783-47e7-abe0-61f1a59278b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a110ba4c0534ea5ce567f6aa3e0aae98d1320ea5d06a7ac84a19c86cbe44e93f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Even though several players may take part in the Trade, the only player that performs the Action is the one that started it.

A Crafted Item cannot be built if its card is not available, even if you have the required blue components.\n\n2. Actions from Action Cards\nEach Character has its own, partially unique set of 10 Action cards representing the Actions which can be performed by this Character. The description of each Action is detailed on the corresponding Action card. To perform an Action from an Action card, discard this card from your hand (face up) and pay its Cost. Important: in this case, the Cost of an Action is the number of Action cards you must discard from your hand, in addition to the Action card with the performed Action. If an Action card contains two sections separated by [OR], the player chooses the one they want to perform.\n\n3. Actions from Item Cards\nSome Item cards allow a Character to perform specific Actions. Their description is provided on the Item cards.\n\n4. Actions from Room Tiles\nMost of the Rooms allow a Character to perform a specific Action. The description of each Room Action is provided on the Room sheet.\n\nMovement and Exploration Tokens\nMoving around the ship is one of the basic activities of the Characters during the game. Characters will roam through the ship to discover additional rooms, find items that are useful or vital to their survival, complete their objectives, repair dangerous and malfunctioning gear or put out fires, to find - in the end - a way out of this mess.\n\nRooms and Corridors\nCharacter miniatures may be placed and perform Actions only in ROOMS (keep in mind that Special Rooms, such as the Hibernatorium, Engines or Cockpit are treated as normal Rooms). Escape Pod tokens are the only exception to the rule above. Intruder miniatures may also only be placed in Rooms. CORRIDORS connect the Rooms, and are used to move between Rooms, though neither Characters nor Intruders can ever stop in them for any reason. The effects of moving through any given Corridor are resolved AFTER moving into the Room.\nMovement Action\nThe most common Action used to move around the ship is MOVEMENT. Performing a Movement Action means moving the miniature of your Character to a neighboring Room. Two Rooms are treated as neighboring when they are directly connected to each other by 1 Corridor. Closed Doors block the \"neighboring\" status for the players' Movement. After entering a Room, always resolve the following steps: If this Room tile was unexplored (face down), turn it over (face up). After doing that reveal the exploration token lying on that Room tile. If the Character enters an empty Room (explored or unexplored, with neither Characters nor Intruders), perform a NOISE ROLL. If there is anyone (either a Character or an Intruder) in the Room the Character is entering, do not perform a NOISE ROLL. Hint: Aside from the advantage of moving around the ship in groups (entering Rooms that already contain Characters), such tactics may generate an additional risk. Some events in the game instruct all Characters to perform a Noise roll - in such a case, bigger groups sharing a common Room might be in trouble.\nOther Movement Actions\nSome of the Actions allow a Character to perform Movement, but modify its rules in some way - like Careful Movement and Reconnaissance. Important: To perform a Movement Action to leave a Room containing an Intruder, you must use the Escape rule.\nExploration Tokens\nThe front side of each Exploration token displays: a number indicating the amount of Items in a given Room, and a special effect symbol. They are resolved in the following way:\n1. Set up the amount of items in a room: After revealing the Exploration token, rotate the Room tile until the number shown on the token faces the Item Counter symbol printed on the board, next to the Room tile slot. This is the exact amount of Items that can be obtained from this Room. You do not set the amount of Items in a Nest or in a Room Covered in Slime.\n2. Resolve Special Effect: An Exploration token may generate the following effects:\n1. Silence: Nothing happens. Do not perform a Noise roll for this Movement. If the Character has a Slime marker on their Character board, then resolve \"Danger\" instead.\n2.", "start_char_idx": 24261, "end_char_idx": 28837, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33e3134a-5783-47e7-abe0-61f1a59278b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "33e3134a-5783-47e7-abe0-61f1a59278b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58bc04a-3687-4aac-adda-30c622da9546", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "ac492e49fe5fe5b17600e4d28e54001c5455863187a1dbaaae79f92a6ff0a8d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4355a52e-f9f6-404f-b1f2-9a7a0eda2cd6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "b8cc7603ef0ef0a6e758f92df2a0cad1b9a1007afdb393f207e0260452430b06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23d668ff-3f6d-41e0-b39d-d17598020218", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "566c092e2d17bf23d6d218fa98c02f74d5f966dbb3a2f34432cff428f4e84d3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Exploration Tokens\nThe front side of each Exploration token displays: a number indicating the amount of Items in a given Room, and a special effect symbol.

Resolve Special Effect: An Exploration token may generate the following effects:\n1. Silence: Nothing happens. Do not perform a Noise roll for this Movement. If the Character has a Slime marker on their Character board, then resolve \"Danger\" instead.\n2. Danger: Do not perform a Noise roll for this Movement. If there is an Intruder in the neighboring Room (and it is not in Combat with any Character), move it to this Room. If there is more than one Intruder eligible, move them all. If there are no Intruders in any of the neighboring Rooms (or if they are in Combat), place a Noise marker in each Corridor connected to that Room without a Noise marker already placed (counting Technical Corridors if there is an Entrance in the Room).\n3. Slime: Place a Status marker in the indicated slot of your Character board to indicate they have been covered with slime.\n4. Fire: Place a Fire marker in this Room.\n5. Malfunction: Place a Malfunction marker in this Room.\n6. Doors: Place a Door token in the Corridor by which you have entered that Room.\nAfter resolving an Exploration token, remove it from the game. Exploration tokens are placed on unexplored Rooms, so they are only resolved once, when their Room is entered for the first time in the game.\n\nNoise Roll\nNoises echo throughout the Nemesis decks... sometimes from the ship's machinery, but sometimes from Intruders. Remember: If you are moving into a Room with either another Character or an Intruder - you do NOT perform a Noise roll. Roll a Noise die and resolve the result:\n1) Result Of 1, 2, 3 Or 4: Place a Noise marker in a Corridor with a number corresponding to the result of your Noise roll, and connected to the Room you have entered (counting Technical Corridors, if there is an Entrance in the Room). Any given Corridor may never hold more than 1 Noise marker. If you are instructed to place a Noise marker in a Corridor that already contains one, resolve an Encounter instead.\n2) Danger: If there is an Intruder in the neighboring Room (and it is not in Combat with any Character ), move it to this Room. If there is more than one Intruder eligible, move them all. If there are no Intruders in any of the neighboring Rooms (or if they are in Combat), place a Noise marker in each Corridor connected to that Room that does not already have a Noise marker (counting Technical Corridors, if there is an Entrance in the Room).\n3) Silence: Nothing happens. No Noise marker is placed. If the Character has a Slime marker on their Character board, then resolve \"Danger\" instead.\nEven if the Noise marker is in the Corridor with the Closed Door, it affects the WHOLE Corridor. Noise markers NEVER affect only a part of the Corridor \"on one side of the Door\". When there is a Noise marker in the Technical Corridors space, it is treated as if it was in each Technical Corridors Entrance on the whole board.\n\nAdditional notes about intruder movement\nIntruders move at different times of the game (for example when resolving an Event card during the Event Phase). Whenever a rule makes you move one or more Intruders, it explains in detail how to do it. Important: If an Intruder ends its movement in an unexplored Room, do not remove it and don't reveal the Room (or its Exploration token). If you are instructed to place an Adult Intruder on the board, but all 8 models are already on board - the Adult Intruders retreat. Remove all Adult Intruder models that are not in Combat and put the corresponding Intruder tokens back in the Intruder bag (if possible). Then, place an Adult Intruder model in the Room where Encounter occured.\n\nTechnical Corridors\nThe technical corridor network of the Nemesis allows the crew to repair its various systems.", "start_char_idx": 28022, "end_char_idx": 32291, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23d668ff-3f6d-41e0-b39d-d17598020218": {"__data__": {"id_": "23d668ff-3f6d-41e0-b39d-d17598020218", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58bc04a-3687-4aac-adda-30c622da9546", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "ac492e49fe5fe5b17600e4d28e54001c5455863187a1dbaaae79f92a6ff0a8d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "33e3134a-5783-47e7-abe0-61f1a59278b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/laura/Documents/Code/2024-04-12_llamaindex-flask/llamaindex-flask/documents/nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_name": "nemesisrulebook.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 81192, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "7e0be23074b83b464fe22994cb2151535295ba9ad1ec603169668c0a7fc34c31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a04471fc-891a-4f1f-b7b4-57f4f5d35868", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74f60f28c69adff487bda589957ea4ea04f3c2f944635e0ea275972cb9f1ef12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Additional notes about intruder movement\nIntruders move at different times of the game (for example when resolving an Event card during the Event Phase).

Then, place an Adult Intruder model in the Room where Encounter occured.\n\nTechnical Corridors\nThe technical corridor network of the Nemesis allows the crew to repair its various systems. Unfortunately, it is also a great way for the Intruders to move around the ship. Normal characters can't use technical corridors - the thought of getting lost or meeting an Intruder is enough to discourage them. Both the Technical Corridors Entrances (present in some Rooms) and the special space of Technical Corridors are not accessible to the Characters. The Technical Corridors Action card from the Mechanic Action deck and the Technical Corridor Plans Item card are the only exceptions to this rule. If (for example as the result of a Noise roll) a Noise marker should be placed and the number leads to the Technical Corridor Entrance, this Noise marker should be placed on the Technical Corridors space. Any given Corridor may never hold more than 1 Noise marker. If you are instructed to place a Noise marker in a Corridor that already contains one, resolve an Encounter instead. Door tokens can never be placed in Technical Corridors. If an Intruder moves to the Technical Corridors Entrance, then it disappears in the ducts: discard all its Injury markers, return its token to the Intruder bag, and remove its miniature from the board. If there was a Noise marker on the Technical Corridors space, do not remove it.\n\nSlime Marker\nAs long as the Character has a Slime marker on their Character board, each \"Silence\" result of a Noise roll (and each \" Silence \" exploration token) should instead be considered as \" Danger\". A Character may only have 1 Slime marker at a time. If they are instructed to get another while they have one, nothing happens. Note: A Character may get a Slime marker due to many reasons, not only when resolving an Exploration token. A Character may get rid of the Slime marker by using the Clothes Item card (see Item cards) or taking a Shower Room Action (see Room sheet). The Slime marker is an universal Status marker, placed in the Slime slot of the Character board.\n\nFire Marker\nFire markers have three functions - 1) they wound Characters staying in Rooms on fire, 2) they deal Injuries to Intruders and 3) they may cause the explosion of the whole ship.\nEvery time a Character ends their round (each round!) in a Room with a Fire marker, this Character suffers 1 Light Wound. Remember that 1 round is 2 Actions of 1 Character (or 1 Action and pass, or simply pass). Important: Characters suffer Wounds from Fire only after they finished their round. If the Character passes, they suffer 1 Light Wound from Fire at the end of their round, but they won't suffer any more Wounds from Fire this turn, even if other Characters play their round after them. During each Event Phase, during the Fire Damage step, each Intruder present in a Room with a Fire marker suffers 1 Injury. There are 8 Fire markers in the game. If you are instructed to place a Fire marker and there are no more markers in the pool, the ship explodes and the game ends. Note: Some Event cards may cause the Fire to spread to neighboring Rooms or cause Malfunctions in Rooms already on fire, so be careful! Any given Room may never hold more than 1 Fire marker. If you are instructed to place another one, nothing happens. Any discarded Fire marker goes back to the Fire marker pool. You can still use a Room Action when there is a Fire marker in the Room.

You can still use a Search Action when there is a Fire marker in the Room.\n\nMalfunction Marker\nMalfunction markers have two purposes - 1) they prevent you from using this Room's Actions and 2) may cause loss of integrity of the ship's hull - meaning that everything on board dies. If there is a Malfunction marker in a Room, that Room's Action is no longer available. The Search Action works normally, though. Various Action cards (like Repair Action cards) and Items (like the Tools Item card) may be used to discard a Malfunction marker. Important: A Malfunction marker can never be placed in the Nest or in the Room Covered In Slime. Note: A Malfunction marker may be placed in a Room due to many reasons, other than resolving an Exploration token (like some Events or Actions). They disable even Special Rooms (such as the Hibernatorium, Cockpit, Engines). Note: A Malfunction marker in the Hibernatorium has no effect on already Hibernated Characters. The status of the Engines (Damaged/Working) is never affected by Malfunction markers placed in their Room. There are 8 Malfunction markers in game. If you are instructed to place a Malfunction marker and there are no more markers in the pool, the ship loses hull integrity and the game ends. Any given Room may never hold more than 1 Malfunction marker. If you are instructed to place another one, nothing happens. Any discarded Malfunction marker goes back to the Malfunction marker pool. If there is a Malfunction marker in a Room with a Computer, the Computer is unavailable - as if there was no Computer Icon.\n\nDoor Token\nDoor tokens are only placed in Corridors. Each Corridor may never hold more than 1 Door token. Doors tokens do not affect Noise markers. Doors in each Corridor can have three different status: Open, Closed or Destroyed. Many things can change their status (like Intruder movement, Events, Actions etc). Closed doors are marked with a standing Door token in a Corridor. A Closed Door prevents Characters and Intruders moving through this Corridor (Grenade throwing is also affected). When an Intruder tries to move through a Corridor with a Closed Door token, the Intruder does not move, but destroys this Door instead. Destroyed doors are marked with a lying Door token. Movement is allowed through this Corridor. A Destroyed Door can never be Closed again. The only exception to this rule is the Plasma Torch Item (see the Mechanic's Item cards). Open Doors - to mark that the Door is Open, simply remove the Door token from the Corridor. At the beginning of the game, all Corridors have Open Doors. If there are no Door tokens left in the pool when you are instructed to place a Door, take any Door token on the board and place it in the required Corridor. If several Intruders are moving from the same Room, their movement is considered simultaneous: they destroy the Door and all stay in the starting Room. Door tokens are ignored when resolving Encounters.\n\nNemesis Encounter and Combat\nEncounter\nAn Encounter is any instance of an Intruder appearing on board in a Room where a Character is present (after drawing an Intruder to -ken from the Intruder bag). An Encounter may also be triggered by the effects of some Event cards (like Hatching) or some of the Intruder Attack cards. Note: An Intruder moving from one Room to another Room containing a Character does not count as an Encounter. To resolve an Encounter, follow the steps listed below:\n1. Discard all Noise markers from all the Corridors connected to this Room (including Technical Corridors, if there is a Technical Corridors Entrance).\n2.

Discard all Noise markers from all the Corridors connected to this Room (including Technical Corridors, if there is a Technical Corridors Entrance).\n2. Draw 1 Intruder token from the Intruder bag. Each Intruder token has an Intruder Symbol on one side, and a number on the opposite side.\n3. Place an Intruder miniature in the Room. The Intruder type must correspond to the Intruder Symbol shown on the token. For a description of each Intruder symbol, see the Intruder board. Compare the number on the Intruder token with the number of cards in the player's hand (Action and Contamination cards are counted). If the number of Action cards in the player's hand is lower than the number in the Intruder token, a Surprise Attack occurs. If the number of Action cards is equal to or higher, nothing happens. \n4. Put the drawn Intruder token aside - it may return to the bag if an Intruder of that type hides (by entering the Technical Corridors during the Intruder Movement).\nSurprise Attack: The Surprise Attack is an Intruder Attack which only occurs during an Encounter. If the player has fewer cards in their hand than the the number printed on the drawn Intruder token, a Surprise Attack takes place.\nBlank Token: If a player draws the Blank token, place a Noise marker in each Corridor connected to the Room in which this Encounter took place. If the Blank token was the last token in the Intruder bag: Add 1 Adult Intruder token to the Intruder bag. If there are no Adult Intruder tokens available, nothing happens. Return the Blank token to the Intruder bag. This Encounter ends.\nEntering a room with an Intruder\nEach time a Character enters a Room occupied by an Intruder, do not resolve an Encounter. The Intruder and the Character are immediately considered to be in Combat.\n\nCombat\nWhenever both a Character and an Intruder are in the same Room, they are considered to be in Combat. In Combat, a Character may attack an Intruder or Escape during their Action round. Intruders attack Characters during the Event Phase.\nThe Character may attack an Intruder in the same Room using a Shoot Action or a Melee Attack Action during their round.\n\nShoot Action\nif a Character is in a Room with an Intruder and has a Weapon with at least 1 Ammo, they may perform a Shoot Basic Action against that Intruder:\n1. Choose a Weapon and 1 Intruder you want to shoot.\n2. Discard 1 Ammo from that Weapon's card.\n3.

Before you move your miniature, resolve an Intruder Attack. If there is more than 1 Intruder in the Room you are trying to Escape from, resolve a separate Intruder Attack for each Intruder. If your Character survives, you end your Movement in the neighboring Room. If there is no one in that Room, perform a Noise roll. If it was an unexplored Room, Explore it according to the standard rules. If you die, your Character Corpse stays in the Room you tried to Escape from. Important: Some Actions, other than the Basic Movement Action, allow a Character to Escape, but additionally modify this rule - for example uppressive Fire, Covering Fire (see the Action cards). Note: If the Character Escapes to a Room without any other Characters or Intruders, perform a Noise roll just like after a standard move.\nDesperate times call for desperate measures. A metal pipe, a heavy tool, a rifle butt, anything can become an improvised weapon in a hopeless situation. Close combat works like shooting, but the risks are far greater. If the attack fails to hit, then the character immediately suffers a Serious Wound, in addition of the risk of being contaminated.\n\nIntruder Injuries and Death\nWhen any Intruder suffers Injuries (for example as a result of a successful Character attack or from Fire), place the corresponding number of Injury markers on its base. Then, check the Injury Effect:\n- Larva and Egg: 1 Injury is enough to kill them. Remove their miniature from the board.\n- Creeper or Adult Intruder: draw 1 Intruder Attack card, ignore everything on this card except the \"blood\" icon in the upper left corner of the card. If the number in the \"blood\" icon of the card is equal to or lower than the current number of Injury markers on this Intruder, it is killed - remove its miniature and place 1 Intruder Carcass token in the Room where it was slain (indicating from now on an Intruder Carcass Object). If the number in the \"blood\" icon is higher, the Intruder is still alive. Breeder or Queen - draw 2 Intruder Attack cards, add the value of their \"blood\" icons, and compare the total to the current number of Injury markers of this Intruder. Resolve the result using the same method as above for the Creeper and the Adult Intruder. Note: The \"blood\" icon represents the current \"endurance\" of the Intruder. This value may vary for a given individual, depending on the cards drawn after each successful attack. There are also two \"Five Injuries\" tokens provided, which may help you with tracking Injuries on bigger Intruders - such as Queen or Breeders.\n\nIntruder Retreat\nIntruders might seem savage, but they are not mindless.

They can run away if they suffer too many wounds, or if someone is lucky enough to damage one of their vulnerable parts. During the Injury Effect check, if there is a Retreat arrow in the \"blood\" icon of any of the drawn Intruder Attack cards, then this Intruder flees: Draw an Event card and move the Intruder through the Corridor whose number appears in the Intruder movement section of the card. Then, discard that Event card. The Queen and the Breeders will retreat if any of the 2 Intruder Attack cards drawn displays the Retreat symbol.\n\nIntruder Attack\nIntruder Attacks happen in three cases:\n1. Surprise Attack\n2. Intruder Attack step in the Event Phase\n3. Character's Escape\nEach Intruder Attack follows the steps below:\n1. Choose the Character who is the target of this Intruder Attack. The Intruder may only attack a Character in the same Room. If there is more than one Character in the Room, Intruders always attack the Character whose player has the fewest Action cards in their hand. In the event of a draw, the Character with the First Player token (or the next player in turn order) is attacked. In case of a Surprise Attack, the Character targeted is the one who triggered the Encounter. In case of an Escape, the Character targeted is the one who is performing the Escape Action.\n2. Draw and resolve 1 Intruder Attack card: If the card displays an Intruder Symbol corresponding to the attacking Intruder, resolve the effect described on the card. If not, the attack misses.  Important: During an Intruder Attack, ignore the \"blood\" icon in the upper left corner of the Intruder Attack card. After resolving an Intruder Attack card, it is placed in the Intruder discard pile. If you run out of cards in the Intruder Attack deck, take its discard pile and reshuffle it. It becomes the new Intruder Attack deck.\nInfest\nIf the Intruder Attack is performed by a Larva, do not draw any Intruder Attack cards. Apply the following instead: Remove the Larva miniature from the board and place it on the Character board of the target of this attack, on the miniature picture; the targeted player gets 1 Contamination Card.\n\nContamination Cards\nIn addition to Wounds, Characters may get Contamination cards (for example as the result of some Intruder Attacks). When a Character gets a Contamination card (regardless of the source), draw it from the Contamination deck and place it on top of their Action discard pile. Contamination cards are a disadvantage for the player, because they are kept in hand like a normal Action card, but they do not provide any additional Actions and you cannot spend them to pay the Costs of the other Actions. Each Contamination card contains hidden information: the Character may be INFECTED or not. This information is hidden by colorful patterns in the text field. Unless the card is \"Scanned\", this information remains unknown to the player until the end of the game. If the Character does not Scan their Contamination cards before the end of the game, then at the end of the game, they may lose the game because of these cards. Note: Some Event cards may force the player to Scan their Contamination cards.\nScanning and Removing contamination cards\nA Character may try to get rid of their Contamination cards through several different ways (like the Rest Action card, a Canteen, Shower or Surgery Room Action and the Antidote Item Action).

A Scan is performed in the following way: Take the Scanner and place its red foil part over the coded field of the Contamination card you're Scanning. In one of the lines of text, the word INFECTED may appear. If not, the card is NOT INFECTED. Note: Look closely at the cards, because some of the coded words may be seemingly similar to INFECTED. In both of these cases, any additional Scanning effect is explained in the description of the given Action card, Room Action or Item Action. If you're INFECTED, place a Larva miniature on your Character board (and do not remove this Contamination card!). If there is already a Larva on your Character board, your Character dies - additionally, place 1 Creeper in the Room where you died. If any rule asks you to remove a Contamination card, remove this card from the game.\nAs the old saying goes, if it bleeds, we can kill it. But what if we can't be sure whether the fluid coming out of the alien wretch is, in fact, blood? Either way, it's helpful to know that shooting the Intruders hurts them. The problem is, you can never be sure how bad their condition is and if you can kill them before ammo runs out... The crew has no past experience with Intruders, and so players cannot be sure how much damage is needed to kill one!\n\nCharacter Wounds and Death\nDuring the game, Characters may suffer two types of Wounds: Light and Serious.\nLight Wounds: When a Character suffers a Light Wound, place a Wound marker in the upper space of the Light Wound Track on their Character board. If a Wound marker is already there, move it to the lower space. A marker on the lower space of the Light Wounds Track means 2 Light Wounds. If there is already a Wound marker on the lower space, discard it from the Light Wound Track and the Character suffers a Serious Wound.\nSerious Wound: When a Character suffers a Serious Wound, draw 1 Serious Wound card and place it next to the Character board. From now on, the player is affected by the effect described on that card. Each type of Serious Wound has a different effect, described on its card. When a Character with 3 Serious Wounds suffers any additional Wound (Light or Serious), they are instantly killed. When a Character dies, remove their miniature from the board and place a Character Corpse token in the Room where they died - from now on, it is considered as a Character Corpse Object. When a Character dies, they drop all their Heavy Objects in the Room they died in. Important: If a Character has several copies of identical Serious Wounds cards, their effects are not cumulative. It will be more difficult to get rid of their effects, though.\n\nDressing and Healing Wounds\nDuring the game, a player may Dress and Heal their Wounds in many ways (using Clothes, Bandages, Medkit Item cards or the Emergency Room Action). Each relevant Item card or Room Action details the Wound treatment. It can be either Dress or Heal.\nDress Serious Wound: Flip a Serious Wound card affecting the Character on its backside. From now on, its effect is ignored, but it still counts against the limit of 3 Serious Wounds.\nHeal: Either remove (in case of a Light Wound) or discard (in case of a Dressed Serious Wound card) the Wound mentioned in the Action effect.\n\nIntruder Weakness Cards\nDuring game setup, you placed 3 random Weakness cards (face down) on the 3 Intruder Weakness slots on the Intruder board.

During the game you will have the possibility to discover these 3 Weaknesses. They represent the crew gaining gradual knowledge on the lifeform that infests the ship. Each of the 3 Weakness cards is placed in a space corresponding to a different Object:\n1. Character Corpse\n2. Intruder Egg\n3. Intruder Carcass\nTo discover a given Weakness card, any Character must research the corresponding Object in the Laboratory Room.\nObject tokens:\nAfter researching an Object, reveal the corresponding Weakness card - flip it face up and leave it on the Intruder board. Discovered Weakness cards modify the basic rules of the Intruders, giving all players a small advantage against them.\n\nNemesis Objects and Items\nHaving appropriate Items will often make the difference between life and death for a Character. Items may be obtained in a few different ways: Each Character starts the game with 1 dedicated Item card (Weapon). Each Character starts the game with 2 Quest Items. These 2 cards are placed face down on their horizontal side. Once their requirements are fulfilled, the cards are flipped face up on their vertical side and become normal Item cards. During the game, a Character may also find various Items in the Rooms, using the Search Action card. During the game, a Character may also create special Crafted Items by assembling other Items in their possession using the Craft Basic action. The Characters may also discover Heavy Objects during the game (Character Corpse, Intruder Carcass and Eggs), which are not represented by cards but by special tokens or miniatures. They can be carried around by the Characters. These Objects don't have their own rules and they are used at specific times - when an Action card, Room Action or Event calls for it (for example, the Laboratory Room Action). Important: Some Items are marked as One Use Only: after using such an Item, its card is discarded.\n\nCharacter Hands and Inventory\nThere are two types of Item cards: Heavy Items (kept in the Character's Hands) and normal Items (kept in the Inventory). Characters may also carry Heavy Objects tokens.\nInventory\nAll normal Items may be kept secret from the other players - put them in your Inventory (plastic card holder), so the other players can only see the card backs. The other players can see the color of the Items in your Inventory, but they do not know exactly what you have there. However, when any Item card is used, it must be shown to all the other players. There is no limit to the number of Items that can be placed in your Inventory.\nHand icon and heavy items and objects\nHeavy Items (as Weapons) are indicated by the Hand icon. They can never be kept secret from the other players and cannot be put in the Inventory. When you find/gain a Heavy Item (or pick up a Heavy Object) you want to keep, it must be placed in one of the two Hand slots of the Character, meaning that a Character may carry up to 2 Heavy Items/Objects. If both of the Character's Hand slots are already taken and you want to take another Heavy Item/Object, you must Drop 1 of the carried Heavy Items/Objects. Each Weapon acquired by Searching comes into play loaded with 1 AMMO token. A Weapon can never exceed its Ammo capacity, shown on the Weapon card. Sometimes, you can Add an Item card to another Item card (like the Extended Magazine or the Autoloader). It means that the added item is placed next to the indicated Item card. From now on, both cards are treated as one. Important: The Duct Tape Item card allows you to combine 2 Heavy Items, so they take up only 1 Hand slot - but it doesn't apply to Objects!

Heavy Objects are tokens: Intruder Eggs (they are most often found in the Nest Room), Character Corpse (the Character Corpse token, representing either a dead Character or the body found in the Hibernatorium at the start of the game), Intruder Carcass (a Carcass token is placed after the death of any Intruder - with the exception of Larvae).\n\nDrop\nA Character may freely Drop any Item / Object from their Hands / Inventory any time during their turn without using an Action. Objects remain in the Room where they are dropped. Items are lost - discard their card. \nThis ship is full of useful stuff. Sometimes you just have to look around the room for a few moments. This Fire Extinguisher might come in handy, those Chemicals with a Zippo will do as a Flamethrower.\n\nSearching\nApart from the Character-dedicated Items (1 Weapon and 2 Quest Items), there are 4 colors of Items in the game: Red (Military), Yellow (Technical), Green (Medical), Blue (Crafted). Three of these decks (Red, Yellow, Green) contain Items which can be found in Rooms when using a Search Action.  The color of any Item found during a Search Action should match the color of the searched Room (yellow Items in yellow Room etc).. A Room's color is the background color under its name and rule text.When searching in a white Room, the player can choose to draw from any of these 3 decks. Each time a Character performs a Search Action in a Room, the Item Counter of that Room is reduced by 1. When the Item Counter reaches 0, the Room has been emptied and cannot be searched anymore. There are some exceptions to this rule, like the Scout's Scavenging Action.\n\nCrafting\nThe fourth (Blue) deck of Item cards contains Crafted Items. These Items cannot be found by searching the Rooms. They can be assembled with a Craft Item Basic Action, using other Items in your possession. You may look through the Crafting deck at any moment of the game. Cards from it are never drawn during the game, instead, when Crafting an Item, look for corresponding Crafted Item card and take it. Crafted Item cards display 2 grey Component icons representing the Components required to build this Item. The Item cards that can be used as components for Crafted Items display a blue Component icon, representing a specific Component that can be used (by discarding the card) to build a Crafted Item. To build a Crafted Item, you must perform a Craft Item Basic Action and discard two Item cards showing the blue Component icons corresponding to the grey Components icons of the Crafted Item you want to build (the first Item card corresponding to the first required Component icon, and the second Item card corresponding to the second required Component icon). You can build four different Crafted Items during the game: Antidote, Taser, Flamethrower, Molotov Cocktail. A Crafted Item cannot be built if its card is not available, even if you have the required blue components.\n\nQuest Items\nQuest Items are NOT available for you to use from the start. Each of them has a special condition you must meet to unlock this Item during the game (specified on the horizontal side of their cards). When you manage to activate a Quest item, you can flip it and treat it as a standard Item (it can occupy a Hand slot, might be discarded, given away, etc).\n\nAttacking Players\nYears of accumulated knowledge of space travels suggest that placing a small group of people in a cramped metal can flying through the unknown for an extended period generates undesirable tensions.

To prevent serious conflict among ship crews, space corporations spend billions of dollars equipping their crews with implants which create a strong psychic barrier and inhibit direct violence against Humans. This is why crew members cannot directly attack one another. Characters cannot directly attack other Characters, but they may (accidentally or intentionally) harm other Characters as a side effect of their actions. Cutting someone off in a room on fire, activating self-destruct with people still on board, throwing a grenade at an Intruder in a room with other crew members are just a few of the many possibilities...\n\nNemesis Room Sheet\nTo perform any Room Action, a Character must be in the corresponding Room (unless they possesses a special ability clearly saying otherwise). You cannot perform a Room Action when you are in Combat. You cannot perform a Room Action in a Room with a Malfunction marker.\nRooms with a Computer\nSome Rooms have a Computer icon, meaning that there is a Computer in that Room.\nA Computer icon has no significance except when some rule refers to it (some Action cards, Item cards or Event cards). If there is a Malfunction marker in the Room, the Computer is unavailable - as if there was no Computer Icon.\n\nBasic Rooms \"1\"\nAll the 11 Basic Rooms, indicated by the number \"1\" on their back, are present in each game.\n\nBasic Room action - Armory\nRecharge your Energy Weapon: Add 2 Ammo tokens to 1 of your Energy Weapons.\nNote: This Room Action does not reload Classic Weapons. A Weapon can never exceed its Ammo capacity, shown on the Weapon card.\n\nBasic Room action - Comms Room\nSend a Signal: Place a Status marker on the Signal space on your Character board. Sending a Signal is a requirement for some Objectives and has no other game use than that.\n\nBasic Room action - Emergency Room\nTreat your Wounds: Dress all your Serious Wounds OR Heal 1 of your Dressed Serious Wounds OR Heal all your Light Wounds.\n\nBasic Room action - Evacuation Section A, B\nTry To Enter An Escape Pod: You may perform this Action only if any Escape Pod in Section A is Unlocked and has at least 1 empty space. Make a Noise roll. If any Intruder appears in this Room, your attempt to enter an Escape Pod fails. After resolving your Noise roll, if no Intruder has reached the Room, place your Character in one of the Unlocked Escape Pods of Section A, if there's any free space (each Pod has two places and may accommodate up to 2 Characters). See the Escape Pods section at the end of this Room sheet to determine what happens once the Character has entered a Pod. You cannot enter an Escape Pod if any Intruder is present in its corresponding Evacuation Section Room.\n\nBasic Room action - Fire Control System\nInitiate the Fire Control procedure: Choose any 1 Room. Discard a Fire marker from that Room (if there is one). All the Intruders in that Room run away (in a random direction, determined by drawing an Event card - 1 Event card for each Intruder). Hint: You can use Fire Control Procedure even if there is no Fire marker in the Room to make all the Intruders run away from that Room.\n\nBasic Room action - Generator\nInitiate / stop self-destruct Sequence\nSelf-destruct Sequence: Place 1 Status marker on the first, green space of the Self-Destruct Track. From now on, each time you move the Time marker on the Track, also move the marker on the Self-Destruct Track by 1 space.

Discover 1 corresponding Intruder Weakness card. The Object is not discarded after Research. You may Drop it for free, though.\n\nBasic Room action - Nest\nTake one Egg: Take 1 Egg token from the Intruder Board. After that, perform a Noise roll. The Egg tokens placed on the Intruder board represent the Eggs in the Nest. When you take (or destroy) Eggs from the Nest, take them from the Intruder board. When there are no more Eggs in the Nest (they have all been carried away or destroyed), the Nest is considered destroyed - place 1 Injury marker in the Nest to represent this. If there is a Fire marker in a Room containing uncarried Eggs, destroy 1 uncarried Egg during the Fire Damage step of the Event Phase. Note: You cannot perform any Search Action in this Room. Destroying Eggs: Whenever your Character is in a Room with any uncarried Eggs (not carried by any Character), you can try to destroy these Eggs. Resolve this Action as a Shoot Action or Melee Attack Action. Each Injury (of any type) destroys 1 Egg. In the case of a Melee Attack Action, the Character does not draw a Contamination card or suffer Wounds if they miss. You can also throw grenades into a Room with uncarried Eggs as if an Intruder were there. A Grenade destroys 2 Eggs, a Molotov Cocktail destroys 1 Egg. After every single attempt to destroy an Egg, you must perform a Noise roll.\n\nBasic Room action - Storage\nSearch for an Item: Draw 2 cards from the Item deck of a chosen color (Red, Yellow or Green). Pick 1 card and put the other at the bottom of the deck.\n\nBasic Room action - Surgery\nPerform a Surgery procedure: Scan all Contamination cards (from your Action deck, hand and Discard). Remove all Infected cards. If you have a Larva on your Character board, remove it. After Scanning, your Character suffers 1 Light Wound and you automatically pass. Shuffle all your Action cards (including those in your hand) and place them in your Action deck. Note: After a Surgery procedure you always pass your round, and your hand is empty until the start of the next turn.\n\nAdditional Rooms \"2\"\nEach game, only 5 randomly chosen Additional Rooms are used, out of the 9 available. These Rooms are indicated by the number \"2\" on their back.\n\nAdditional Room action - Airlock Control\nStart Emergency Airlock procedure: Choose any 1 other Yellow Room. The Corridors connected to the Room you choose must not contain any Destroyed Doors. Automatically close the Door in each Corridor connected to this Room. Place the Airlock Procedure token in this Room to represent the active Emergency Airlock Procedure. If any of the Doors in Corridors connected to this Room are opened before the current Player Phase ends, remove this token.

Set destination: Move the Destination marker to the chosen space of the Destination Track. Note: You cannot change the Destination when any of the Characters are already hibernating. The player should remember the Coordinates they've checked. You may never Set Destination if there is an Intruder in the Cockpit. Note: At the end of the game, if the ship was not destroyed earlier, the Coordinates card is revealed. The position of the Destination marker indicates the destination of the ship among the four available on the Coordinates card. Note: You cannot perform a Search Action in this Room.\n\nSpecial Room action - Engine #1, 2, 3\nCheck the engine: Check the Engine status in this Engine Room - secretly look at the top Engine token. You don't need to tell the truth about what you saw. The top Engine token indicates the current state of the Engine! Repair (or break) engine: Your Character can perform a Repair / Break Engine Action in this Room (using a Repairs Action or a Tools Item card): take both Engine tokens, secretly check their contents and place them back in the order of your choice. You do not have to tell the truth if you have repaired the Engine or not, but you must tell if you have changed the order of the tokens. You can Repair / Break Engine even if there is a Malfunction marker in the Room and even if you have not checked the status of the Engines. Note: The ship has 3 Engines, two of which must be functional to safely journey back to Earth. At the start of the game, the players don't know which Engine is functional or not. Players may check the Status of a given Engine during the game - for example in its corresponding Engine Room. At the end of the game, if the ship was not destroyed earlier, all the top Engine tokens are revealed to determine if the ship explodes or not during its attempt at a hyperspace jump. Note: You cannot perform any Search Action in this Room.\n\nSpecial Room action - Hibernatorium\nTry To Hibernate: You may perform this Action only if the hibernation chambers are open - the token on the Time Track is on any blue space. Perform a Noise roll. If any Intruder shows up in this Room, your attempt at entering the hibernation chamber has failed. If no Intruder appears, remove your Character miniature from the game - you managed to hibernate safely. From now on, you do not take part in the game any longer. Whether your Character survives or dies along with the ship will be determined at the End of the Game. You cannot change the Destination or start the Self-Destruct when any of the Characters are already hibernating. You may never enter a hibernation chamber if there is any Intruder in the Hibernatorium. Note: You cannot perform any Search Action in this Room. The ship's AI is programmed to protect crew members in hibernation and prevents any maneuver that put their lives at risk.\n\nEscape Pods\nAt the beginning of the game, all Escape Pods are Locked. During play, players may unlock them manually (by using some of the Item cards or Room Actions), or the pods will unlock automatically when any Character dies during the game or when the Self-Destruct marker reaches any yellow space of the Self-Destruct Track. If a given Escape Pod is Unlocked, a Character may enter it (performing a Noise roll first) through the corresponding Evacuation Section Room, as long as there are no Intruders and no Malfunction token in the Room. After entering an Escape pod place the miniature of your Character on one of the two spaces of that Escape Pod token. Afterwards, decide if you want to launch an Escape Pod immediately or wait (maybe for another Character who might want to enter the same Pod and take the second space in it). If you launch immediately (or if you launch in one of the following turns) - remove the miniature of your Character and the Escape Pod token from the game.

From now on, you do not take part in the game any longer. Will you end this game with a victory or not? You'll find out during the Objectives Check at the End of the Game. Any Character in a launched Escape Pod is always treated as if they have arrived on Earth. If you wait, you can decide to launch the Escape Pod at the start of your first round during each Player Phase. You can also, if you wish, exit the Escape Pod voluntarily, without performing any Action - during your round, just place your Character miniature back in the Escape Hatch corresponding to the Pod you are leaving. However, if you do not launch the Escape Pod in your round, it means that you automatically pass this turn. If (while you wait in the Escape Pod) an Intruder appears in this Evacuation Section Room, then all Characters in Escape Pods are automatically returned to that Evacuation Section Room. Once another Character enters the same Escape Pod as you, they can decide to launch the Escape Pod immediately. Note: Heavy objects do not occupy any Character space in an Escape Pod.\n\nSolo Mode\nThis additional game mode was unlocked during the crowdfunding campaign. While Nemesis shines as a standard, semi-cooperative game, you can also try to survive alone. This mode has its own special Objectives deck - solo/coop Objectives. At the start of the game, draw two cards from this deck, instead of the regular Objective cards. Note: Once the first Encounter occurs, you must choose one of these two Objective cards. Important: In this mode, the number of items available in each room is reduced by half, rounding up (if the exploration Tokens shows 1-2 items - set the Item Counter to 1, if 3-4 -set the Item Counter to 2). To win, you must fulfill your objective and survive.\n\nFully Cooperative Mode\nThis additional game mode was unlocked during the crowdfunding campaign. It is intended for players who want to experience a fully cooperative version of the game, without having to fear betrayal from their companions. This mode has its own special Objectives deck - solo/coop Objectives. At the start of the game, draw one card per player, instead of the regular Objective cards. To win the game, ALL these Objectives must be fulfilled and at least 1 Character must survive. Note: If there is one card requiring you to send the Signal - only one Character must do it. If there are two or more such requirements - that many Cha racters must send the Signal! In this fully cooperative mode, the Emergency Room is equipped with a specialized AutoDoc device, allowing the crew to revive any near-death person. Whenever one of the Characters dies, another Character might pick up their Corpse token and carry it to the working Emergency Room. A player whose Corpse is in the Emergency Room places their Character miniature there at the start of the turn. All their Light Wounds are discarded, and all their Serious Wounds are Dressed. Important: the Emergency Room does not work if there's an Intruder or a Malfunction token in it.\n\nPlaying as an Intruder\nThis mode is intended to allow the first eliminated player to keep on playing the game by controlling the Intruders. It also slightly increases the difficulty level for all the remaining players. Note that this mode is optional. The player whose Character dies first gets to control the Intruders infesting the ship and can hunt down the other players.  Important: Only one player takes over the Intruders - the first one to lose their Character. If two Characters die simultaneously, the player with the lower player number gets to control them.\nSetup:\nThe player controlling the Intruders removes all their former Character's components from the game.

When passing, the Intruder player may choose keep 1 card from their hand and discard the rest. During their round, the Intruder Player can play an Intruder Action card in one of the three following ways:\nMove - Move any Intruder through a Corridor with a number matching the one printed on the Intruder Action card. Note: If the Intruder moves to a Technical Corridor, proceed according to the standard rules.\nAttack - Choose any Intruder in the same Room as a Character. The Intruder attacks that Character, following the standard rules, with one exception: the Intruder player draws a number of Intruder Attack cards equal to the number displayed on the Player Intruder card played this round. Then, they choose 1 of these cards to be resolved and put all the others at the bottom of the Intruder Attack deck.\nEffect - resolve the effect described on the Intruder Action card.\nEvent Phase:\nAlmost all of the entire Event Phase is omitted, with the exception of the Time Track and Fire Damage.\nTime Track: Just like in the standard rules, move the Time marker and Self-Destruct marker (if active) 1 space to the right.\nFire Damage: Just like in the standard rules, every Intruder in a Room with a Fire marker suffers 1 Injury. Note: All the other steps do not apply in this mode! Specifically: Intruders do not attack at the end of the Turn (but they still make Surprise Attacks during Encounters or when Characters Escape from Rooms with Intruders). Event cards are not used unless as a result of Intruder Player Action card effects. There is no Intruder Bag Development step.\nVictory condition: The player controlling the Intruders cannot fully win the game. Their goal is to ensure that no other players wins.

While working as a normal ship board, it is primarily designed for campaign play. You can use it in any game mode, but keep in mind that it is more difficult to survive on it. One of the features of this ship layout is the double set of Technical Corridors. They work as usual, but each one is not connected to the other (any Noise marker in the \"red\" Technical Corridors is separate from the \"blue\" Technical Corridors). Another feature is that some of the Rooms are connected to another Room through a pair of Corridors. They are separate from each other, so any Closed Doors in one Corridor do not affect the other. During Game Setup, place the Evacuation sections A and B face up on the highlighted spot on the above map.
